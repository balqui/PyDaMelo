PYthon DAta Mining ELementary Objects

Partly migrated to Python3 but not completely.

===

(To revamp into Python3 urgently!)

===

Trying to get each single element to work as easily as possible.

Want to handle either relational or transactional or multirelational
data, while the user does not know the meaning of any of these.

Want to handle data where missing values are, well, simply missing.

Want to handle data as models, and models as data.

Everything on top of some (eventually any) noSQL thingy.

But this is going to start small, and for now nothing like all of 
this happens at all: just I am clouding a couple of useful programs.
